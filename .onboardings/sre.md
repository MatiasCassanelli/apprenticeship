## The SRE role at Moove it

The SRE role in a software factory is slightly different from what you find in the literature.

## High Availability concept

The most important concept for SRE is availability. A system that is not available cannot perform its function. Availability, in terms of SRE, defines whether a system can fulfill its intended function at a given time or period.
